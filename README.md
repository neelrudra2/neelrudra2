# 👋 Hi, I'm Rudraneel Bhattacharyya

🎓 **B.Tech in Electronics & Communication Engineering**  
📍 National Institute of Technology, Agartala  
🔧 ECE | Systems | Networking | Algorithms  

I am an **Electronics & Communication Engineering undergraduate** with a strong inclination towards **software-driven system design**, **computer networks**, and **digital signal & image processing**. My work lies at the intersection of **core electronics fundamentals and practical software implementation**, with hands-on experience in **network programming, simulation, and algorithmic problem solving**.

I enjoy building **real-world systems**, simulating complex environments, and understanding how low-level concepts translate into scalable applications.
